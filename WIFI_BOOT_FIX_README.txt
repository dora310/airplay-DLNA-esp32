ESP32-S3 v3.1.0 deep WiFi/boot stability replacement files
============================================================

Copy the extracted files into the ROOT of the GitHub repository and allow
Windows to replace the existing files. Keep the directory structure intact.

Files replaced:
  CMakeLists.txt
  .gitignore
  .github/workflows/build-esp32s3-bin.yml
  main/main.c
  main/network/wifi.c
  main/settings.c
  sdkconfig.defaults
  sdkconfig.defaults.esp32s3

Important:
  1. Commit and push all four replacements.
  2. Run the "Build ESP32-S3 installation BIN" GitHub Actions workflow.
  3. Download the new artifact from that run; do not reuse an older BIN.
  4. Erase the ESP32-S3 flash completely.
  5. Flash the new *-install.bin at address 0x0.
  6. Reset the board and look for ESP32-AirPlay-Setup.

Changes in this patch:
  - Forces the same DIO/80 MHz/16 MB image header as the known-working image.
  - Deletes stale generated sdkconfig/build output before every CI build.
  - Verifies the setup SSID and flash mode in the generated sdkconfig.
  - Verifies that the merged install image is a valid ESP32 DIO image.
  - Starts the setup AP before optional v0.3 services.
  - Makes optional DSP/source/monitor services non-fatal at boot.
  - Disables unstable OTA rollback defaults for fresh installations.
  - Does not attempt STA connection when no SSID is saved.
  - Treats an empty stored SSID as unconfigured.
  - Uses OPEN station auth threshold when credentials are blank.
  - Keeps the AirPlay and DLNA service structure unchanged.

After extraction, GitHub Desktop should show all listed files as modified.
Run only the new workflow result and check that the artifact contains
flash_args and flasher_args.json as well as the two BIN files.
